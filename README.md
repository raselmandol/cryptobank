Project Blockchain Bank is a web-based project built with PHP(Laravel), which is an online(Blockchain) based banking system. Users can deposit money, send money, withdraw money, take loans, make payments and many more, all the transactions can be done by cryptocurrencies and popular payment systems(eg. Pypal, Blockchain, Stripe, Coinbase etc). This is a secure and safe way to keep and send money, especially cryptocurrencies. The transactions chain is recorded and quarantined so that the bad people can not make a change even if they access the transactions chain, it's safe. In the control panel, all possible secure systems are added. The main admin can give special users special roles/permissions so that every user can do their job individually.
